### Blog Images
Add blog post featured images in subdirectories:

## Image Guidelines

### File Formats
- Use PNG for logos and graphics with transparency
- Use JPG for photographs and complex images
- Use SVG for simple icons and graphics when possible

### Optimization
- Compress images before uploading
- Use appropriate dimensions for their intended use
- Consider retina displays (2x resolution)

### Naming Convention
- Use lowercase letters
- Use hyphens instead of spaces
- Be descriptive: `gift-sharing-screenshot.png`

## Responsive Images

For responsive design, consider providing multiple sizes:
- `image-name.png` (standard)
- `image-name@2x.png` (retina/high-DPI)
- `image-name-mobile.png` (mobile optimized)

## Adding Images to Posts

In blog posts, reference images like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/assets/images/your-image.png)
```

For responsive images:

```html
<img src="/assets/images/your-image.png" 
     srcset="/assets/images/your-image@2x.png 2x" 
     alt="Description">
```
