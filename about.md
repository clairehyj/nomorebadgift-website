# About NoMoreBadGift

NoMoreBadGift is a revolutionary social gift-sharing app that transforms the way we discover, share, and give gifts. Our mission is simple: **never give a bad gift again**.

## Our Story

We've all been there ‚Äì standing in a store, completely lost about what to buy for someone special. Or worse, watching someone open a gift you thought was perfect, only to see that polite smile that says "thanks, but this isn't really me."

That's why we created NoMoreBadGift. We believe that gift-giving should be joyful, meaningful, and stress-free for both the giver and receiver.

## How It Works

### üéÅ **Discover Perfect Gifts**
Browse gifts shared by friends and see what's trending in your community. No more guessing what people might like.

### üë• **Connect with Friends**
Follow friends and family to see their gift preferences, favorites, and wishlist updates in real-time.

### üì± **Organize & Track**
Keep all your gift ideas organized in one place. Track favorites, set reminders for special occasions, and never forget an important date.

### üîç **Stay Trendy**
Discover the latest gift trends and popular items that are making people happy right now.

## Our Mission

We're building a world where:
- Every gift is thoughtful and appreciated
